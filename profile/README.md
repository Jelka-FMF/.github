# Jelka FMF

Programmable Christmas tree at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana.

## About

At the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/), as part of the [FMF Programming Club](https://programerski-klub-fmf.github.io/), we set up a programmable Christmas tree. The project was made possible with the sponsorship of [Abelium](https://abelium.si/) and [Acex](https://acex.si/).

The tree will be located at the entrance of the building at [Jadranska 21](https://www.google.si/maps/place/Jadranska+ulica+21,+1000+Ljubljana) and lit from morning until the building closes.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute your own pattern for running on Jelka FMF and already have programming knowledge, please check out the [Storži](https://github.com/Jelka-FMF/Storzi) repository that contains already-existing patterns and instructions for submitting your own patterns.

If you would like to submit a pattern but do not have programming knowledge yet, you can check out [Jelkly](https://jelkly.fmf.uni-lj.si/docs), a Scratch-like visual programming tool for creating your own Jelka FMF patterns (WIP).
